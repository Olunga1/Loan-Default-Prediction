# Loan-Default-Prediction
For this project, the goal was to build a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan defaults.

## Summary
For this project, the goal was to build a machine learning model to predict the probability of loan defaults.

## Solution
 

The solution successfully met the project objectives by creating a predictive model that:

Handles data imbalance effectively.

Provides accurate default probabilities for loan applicants.

Can be leveraged for strategic decision-making in credit risk management.


## Approach

Data Exploration and Understanding

## Data Preprocessing

Handling Imbalance

Model Development: Developed an ensemble model with soft voting to combine strengths of different classifiers.

Evaluation and Refinement: Validated the model using the ROC AUC score and made necessary adjustments to improve performance.

Prediction and Submission: Generated final predictions on the test data and prepared the output for submission.
